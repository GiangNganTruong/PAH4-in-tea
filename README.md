# PAH4-in-tea

## Introduction
This repository contains the R scripts used for statistical analysis and health risk assessment in the study:
**PAH4 in Ready-to-Drink Tea in Taiwan: Determination using HPLC-FLD and Health Risk Assessment**

My initial project aims to 
1. Develop and validate an HPLC-FLD method for PAH4 detection in RTD tea.
2. Analyze 51 commercial RTD tea samples (green, oolong, black) from the Taiwanese market.
3. Assess PAH4 contamination levels and compare with traditional tea infusion studies.
4. Conduct a probabilistic health risk assessment using Monte Carlo simulation.

In this repo, I publish my code in R to implement:
-   Best-fit mean estimation for interval-censored PAH4 concentration data
-   Probabilistic Monte Carlo simulation for dietary exposure and risk assessment
-   Heat map visualization of tea concentrations

## Repo structure
included once finalized 

## Packages Installation
To run the code, please install the following packages: tidyverse, ggplot2, dplyr

## Notes:
This repository contains only the statistical analysis code. The original manuscript, raw data, and full methodological details are not included here due to publication and data-sharing restrictions.
